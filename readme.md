Comments as GitHub pull requests for Jekyll (and other static site generator) websites.

Currently a work in progress!

Thanks to Miles Sabin ([twitter](https://twitter.com/milessabin) & [github](https://github.com/milessabin)) for the original idea and initial sponsorship. 

Initial development by [Thomas Parslow](http://almostobsolete.net). Pull requests very welcome.

Deployment
==========

Proper deployment instructions coming soon (this week, hopefully today!)

You can deploy (for free) to Heroku with the button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample)

It will ask you for a Github username *and* a password. This is for the commentor user which will be the user which actually creates the pull requests for comments. I strongly suggest you create a new user for and use it only for this.
